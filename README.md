# Linguistic Similarity Mapping

## Training data for AI models is frequently derived from scraping the entirety of the internet. The project below connects language nodes based on similarity. The size of the nodes corresponds to either the number of web pages in said language or the number of speakers (depending on the data source). Whereas blue nodes correspond to languages 'underrepresented' on the internet, orange nodes are 'overrepresented'. This visualization thus displays the extent to which some languages like English dominate the internet and thus AI models. Such a visualization highlights the need to incorporate more languages into AI models in order to create a more equitable and inclusive digital future.
